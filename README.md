# Hypercube-Visualization
This Python code displays a 4D cube, otherwise known as a hypercube. This cube would shift in and out of the fourth dimension, but because we cannot actually see the fourth
dimension, we can only hypothesize what the cube might look like. I began by coding a rotating 3D cube using vectors, and from there, I was able to add the appropriate amount
of vectors and make adjustments to the code so that it displayed a 4D cube. In order to run the code, please run hypercube-visualization.pde.
